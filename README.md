# What is this?
This is where Sam stores all of his development configuration files. Super useful to ensure consistent settings for setting up a new computer.

## Technologies
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  * `brew install tmux`
* Terminal: [Alacritty v0.15.1](https://alacritty.org/config-alacritty.html)
* Bash: `chsh -s /bin/bash`

### Important Notes
* For `.tmux.conf` to work, first follow the instructions for setting up tpm [here](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm). Be sure to install tmux packages using `prefix + I` inside a tmux session (capital "I").
